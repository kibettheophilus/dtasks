# dTasks
A simple task manager app

## Building and running the app.
- You will need android studio and an emulator or a physical device
- Clone the repository and import to android studio
- Setup the baseUrl under `gradle.properties` (more on this below)
- Hit the run icon 

## Starting the mock server.
- Install mock server
```bash
npm install -g json-server
```
- Open the terminal and cd to `project/db` then run the following command
```bash
json-server --watch db.json --port 3000
```
The server will run at : `http://localhost:3000`
- Find a way to access this from your device, I used [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to forward the server.
  - Once you have ngrok installed, just run
  ```bash
  ngrok http 3000
  ```
- Add the baseUrl under `gradle.properties` as string
```
baseUrl=""
```

## Architecture overview.
The app has been built using a modularized layered architecture. The app has the following modules:
- **app** - entry point to application, contains navigation and overral di logic
- **details** - feature module to handle logic related to a single character details i.e has a viewmodel and composambles
- **list** - feature module to handle logic related to list of characters i.e has a viewmodel and composambles
- **data** - contains the implementation of selecting data between `local` and `network` modules.
- **local** - contains logic for saving data to local device storage
- **network** - contains logic for fetching data from network
- **build-logic** - not an application module but rather a configuration module for setting reausable configs across the project

NB:
This was a simple app and did not need to be modularized, I however decided to use this approach as a way to showcase
my knowledge of working in a modularized codebase.
