# dTasks
A simple task manager app

## Building and running the app.
- You will need android studio and an emulator or a physical device
- Clone the repository and import to android studio
- Hit the run icon 

## Starting the mock server.
- Run the following command:
```bash
chmod +x script.sh
./startserver.sh
```
---
**INFO**
- Installs json-server
- Runs the server
- Installs [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) based on OS
- Exposes local host via chrome
- sets the `baserUrl` in `gradle.properties`
---

## Architecture overview.
The app has been built using a MVVM architecture. 
```
UI -> ViewModel -> Repository -> sources(local and remote)
```
NB:
This was a simple app and did not need to be modularized.

## Conflict resolution strategy.
- I decided to go with the approach of using timestamps when doing a sync
- I have two workers:
   - Immediate -> triggered once during the login process
   - Periodic -> triggered on application setup and runs after every 15 minutes
  
## Running tests.
- Unit Tests
```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```
- Instrumented Tests
```bash
./gradlew testDebugAndroidTest
```
## Kwown Issues & Improvements
- Pushing to server isn't working because `POST /sync` does not exist.
- Improve test coverage
- UI improvements
